          "question": "Which blood tests can I perform as a dentist in my practice?",
          "answer": "With a point-of-care device such as the Igloo Pro Reader, you can quantitatively determine Vitamin D3, CRP, HbA1c, TSH, ferritin and cholesterol (HDL, LDL, total), among others. The measurement is performed from capillary blood via finger prick. Depending on the biomarker, results are available in three to fifteen minutes — directly at the treatment chair, without laboratory submission."
        },
        {
          "question": "How does the Igloo Pro Reader work?",
          "answer": "The Igloo Pro Reader uses immunofluorescence-based technology and delivers quantitative measurement values. The process involves five steps: collect capillary blood via finger prick, apply the sample to the pre-filled test cassette, insert the cassette into the reader, wait for the measurement time, and read the result on the display. No laboratory training is required to operate the device."
        },
        {
          "question": "Is a blood test at the dentist a private health service (IGeL)?",
          "answer": "Yes, provided there is no medical indication within the scope of statutory health insurance. Billing is carried out according to the German Fee Schedule for Physicians (GOÄ), as dentists bill medical services pursuant to § 6 para. 2 GOZ under GOÄ. For patients with statutory health insurance, a written IGeL contract with a cost estimate is required before the test is performed."

          "question": "What quality assurance is required for POCT in dental practices?",
          "answer": "In accordance with the German Medical Association Guideline (RiliBÄK), internal quality controls through regular control measurements and participation in external proficiency testing are mandatory. Results must be documented. PolarisDX supports practices with setting up internal quality control, registering for proficiency tests and ongoing documentation."

        {
          "question": "Which biomarkers are relevant for aesthetic treatments?",
          "answer": "For aesthetic medicine, the most relevant biomarkers are Vitamin D (skin barrier, collagen synthesis), ferritin (hair loss, tissue regeneration), TSH (thyroid function affects skin and hair) and hs-CRP (silent inflammation as a driver of premature skin ageing). These biomarkers provide an objective basis for tailoring treatments individually and documenting results transparently."

          "question": "Why should I perform a blood panel before aesthetic procedures?",

This increases patient safety and enables evidence-based consultation that positions your practice as medically sound."

        {
          "question": "How are thyroid values connected to hair loss?",
          "answer": "The thyroid regulates the entire cell metabolism — including the hair follicle cycle. Both hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism (identifiable by abnormal TSH levels) can cause diffuse hair loss, dry skin and brittle nails. A POC rapid test for TSH provides clarity within minutes and enables targeted referral or therapy initiation."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I offer hormone diagnostics as a private health service?",
          "answer": "Yes. Hormone screenings (TSH, cortisol, testosterone) and micronutrient analyses (Vitamin D, ferritin) are classic individual health services billed privately under GOÄ. Particularly in the beauty segment, there is a high willingness to pay for data-driven consultation that goes beyond purely device-based treatments."
        },
        {
          "question": "What role does Vitamin D play for skin and hair?",
          "answer": "Vitamin D is involved in keratinocyte differentiation, maintaining the skin barrier and regulating the hair follicle cycle. A Vitamin D deficiency — prevalent in over 50% of the population in Central Europe — promotes inflammatory skin conditions, accelerates skin ageing and can exacerbate hair loss. Measurement with the IglooPro takes only a few minutes and forms the basis for targeted supplementation."

          "answer": "Core markers in longevity diagnostics include HbA1c (glycaemic control and AGE formation), hs-CRP (chronic inflammation / inflammaging), a complete lipid profile (cardiovascular risk), TSH (thyroid function) and Vitamin D (immune modulation, bone health). Together, these parameters form a meaningful baseline profile that can be collected directly at the point of care with the IglooPro."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is the difference between preventive and curative diagnostics?",
          "answer": "Curative diagnostics are used when symptoms already exist, to confirm or rule out a disease. Preventive diagnostics, on the other hand, proactively capture biomarkers — before symptoms appear — to identify risk factors early and take countermeasures. In longevity medicine, the focus is on optimising values within the normal range, not merely treating pathological deviations."
        },
        {
          "question": "How often should longevity biomarkers be checked?",
          "answer": "For a thorough longevity monitoring programme, a baseline health check every 3–6 months is recommended, with more frequent checks during active interventions (e.g. dietary changes, supplementation, training programmes). The rapid availability of results at the point of care allows adjustments to be made in real time, rather than waiting for laboratory reports."
        },
        {
          "question": "Which inflammatory markers are important for prevention?",
          "answer": "High-sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP) is the central marker for chronic low-grade inflammation — known as inflammaging. Even mildly elevated values in the range of 1–3 mg/L correlate with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, neurodegeneration and accelerated ageing processes. Regular monitoring enables early intervention through lifestyle measures or targeted supplementation."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I offer health checks as a self-pay service?",
          "answer": "Yes. Preventive biomarker screenings are classic self-pay or private health services (IGeL), as they go beyond the scope of statutory health insurance. Particularly in the longevity segment, there is strong demand for data-driven health checks. The combination of instant analysis and qualified consultation forms an economically attractive service package for your practice."

          "question": "When is a CRP rapid test useful in practice?",
          "answer": "A CRP rapid test is indicated whenever rapid differentiation between bacterial and viral causes is clinically relevant — such as with respiratory tract infections, fever of unknown origin or post-operative monitoring. An elevated CRP value above 40 mg/L suggests bacterial involvement, while lower values may support a wait-and-see approach without antibiotic treatment. Measurement with the IglooPro takes under 5 minutes."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I differentiate bacterial from viral infections with the IglooPro?",
          "answer": "The combination of CRP and PCT (procalcitonin) enables a more differentiated assessment than a single marker alone. CRP rises in both bacterial and viral infections, while PCT responds much more specifically to bacterial infections and sepsis. By simultaneously determining both parameters at the point of care, more informed therapeutic decisions can be made and unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions reduced."

          "answer": "IVDR-compliant POC systems like the IglooPro deliver quantitative results with an analytical precision of CV < 2% and are thus comparable to central laboratory measurements. Quality assurance is maintained through validated test cassettes and internal controls. In clinical practice, POC tests offer the additional advantage that results are immediately available and not influenced by transport times or sample storage."
        },
        {
          "question": "Which inflammation markers can the IglooPro measure?",
          "answer": "The IglooPro supports the determination of CRP (C-reactive protein) as the central acute-phase marker, PCT (procalcitonin) for differentiating bacterial infections, and ferritin, which is relevant not only for iron status but also as an inflammation marker in chronic and acute processes. Through the open platform, additional lateral flow tests for IL-6 and other parameters can be integrated."
