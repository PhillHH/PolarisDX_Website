The use of Lateral Flow Tests (LFT) – known as 'rapid tests' – has become particularly popular. Their simplicity and speed are undisputed, but their reliability depends largely on correct, validated evaluation.",
          "The challenge is to transfer the analytical precision of the central laboratory to the decentralized environment. This requires the validation of LFTs to go beyond the manufacturer's primary performance data (such as general sensitivity and specificity) and consider the entire measurement chain, including the reader and the user."
